Repository for all of the Python Projects done in the Software Developer Bootcamp. Many of the projects within this repo
are only partially completed and were created as practice examples for different aspects of coding in Python. As such
they are not important for other viewers. I will highlight the projects that are examples of my coding experience in the
Relevant Projects section.

RELEVANT PROJECTS
===================
These are projects that have been put together and are as complete as they are going to get. 


-{ Django Project Parent }-
---------------------------
This was the first Django project I put together. It is a mock example of a hotel's website with bare-bones functionality to manage a
menu of foot items. This project was to begin to understand the basic functionality of Django and the flow of data within the program.

-{ DjangoUniversity }-
----------------------
This was a project to continue to develop some understanding of the Django framework. It has a very simple application for adding and removing courses from a database.

-{ django-challenge/Hello_World }-
----------------------------------
The first Django project that I worked through and wrote from scratch. Very simple website that allows the user to add and remove profiles.

-{ django checkbook }-
----------------------
A Django website that allows the user to select a fictinal bank account and make withdrawals and deposits which are stored in the database and presented for viewing.

-{ File Transfer Assignment }-
------------------------------
This is a program that started out small and was updated into it's final version. It was meant as a learning exercise to unerstand file transfer with programs external to windows and how to manipulate data on the computer with python and tkinter.

-{ Phonebook Application }-
---------------------------
Another Tkinter project designed to add phone numbers to a database while allowing the user to update and change those data.
